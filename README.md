# ProjectPlacement

ProjectPlacement is a **student-focused interview preparation platform** built as a foundational model that can grow with community input.

The goal of this project is simple:  
to create a practical space where students can practice, track, and improve their interview readiness — technically, analytically, and structurally.

This repository currently represents an **early but functional version** of the idea. The architecture is intentionally kept clean and extensible so it can be improved, expanded, and shaped further with feedback from other students and developers.

---

## Why this project exists

As a student, interview preparation often feels scattered:
- questions in one place,
- progress tracking in another,
- no clear sense of improvement over time.

ProjectPlacement is an attempt to bring these pieces together into **one structured platform**, while keeping the system simple enough to evolve over time.

---

## Current state of the project

- This is a **basic model**, not a finished product
- The codebase is intentionally lean
- Not all features are fully explored yet
- Several pages and flows are open to improvement and extension

That’s by design.

This project is meant to be **built on**, not locked in.

---

## What the app currently includes

- Authentication and user flow
- Practice and mock-style sections
- Multiple feature pages designed for interview preparation
- Progress-related views and history
- A clean UI structure with dark-mode-first styling
- Modular components that can be reused and expanded

There are multiple pages and routes already present, and more can easily be added without restructuring the app.

---

## Contribution & suggestions

This project is **open to suggestions and improvements**, especially from:
- students preparing for placements
- developers learning full-stack development
- anyone interested in improving interview prep tools

Ideas could include:
- improving existing pages
- adding new practice formats
- refining UX and visual hierarchy
- better progress insights
- performance or structure optimizations

Even small suggestions are welcome.

## Tech overview

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Firebase (auth & data)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Final note

ProjectPlacement is not meant to be perfect —  
it’s meant to be **useful, learnable, and improvable**.

If you’re a student, this is something you can relate to.  
If you’re a developer, this is something you can help shape.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
